=-=-=-=-=-V1.2.2(11/03/2015)-=-=-=-=-= *PUBLIC-STABLE*
+ Confirm dialog box is displayed now when deleting the flow elements!
+ Dragging now updates ONLY the position fields in the text box on the right!
~ KNOWN BUG: Even if the 'Update' button isn't pressed, the flow element data is changed... Need a way to inherit from a class object...
~ KNOWN BUG: If the window has to be scrolled to view the flow elements, then their positioning isn't correct... Needs a way to check the flow element's actual position, not the relative position...

+ Allowed only the entry of numbers in textboxes, which should contain numbers, like ID, X and Y...

+ KNOWN BUG: When selecting any SELECTER (with more than one alternative), it replaces the Choice text for the first alternative with the Choice text for the last alternative.
+ KNOWN BUG: When selecting any SCENE (with more than one Flag Check or Operation), it replaces the operation/check value for the first tab with the same of the last tab.
